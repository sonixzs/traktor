    <br> Chocolate, food product made from cocoa beans, consumed as 
    candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat 
    various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates, 
    it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts 
    of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine

    <h3>History of chocolate</h3>
    <br>The cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 
    years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) 
    and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the 
    substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the(Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (“cacao”) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Mayas phonetic manner of writing.
